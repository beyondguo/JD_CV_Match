LTD \n - 项目简介： \nUHPS ultra-high pressure system is developed by RUISHENBAO&reg; and remains the \nworld&#39;s first automatic ultrahigh pressure pellet press to sample preparation \nfor spectral or X-ray fluorescence analysis, which is maximum press force can \nreach 320T so that it press produces high-quality pressed pellets with a \nmirrorlike surface necessary for optimal XRF results. The UHPS achieves the \ndesired homogeneity and stability of each individual pellet with a maximum of \nreproducibility. There is no dilution effect and effectively overcomes powder \neffect of the XRF thanks to ultra-high pressure direct powder pelletizing press \nmode. It greatly improves the analysis of technical indicators for XRF method \nfor example: the detection limit, precision, accuracy and long-term stability. \nIt effectively expands the XRF on the applicable scope for all kinds of \nsamples. The system can be used as an important direct pressing sample \ntechnology and method for sample preparation of the XRF, XRD, laser \nfluorescence spectroscopy, and laser induced breakdown spectroscopy.\n - 项目职责： \nExplore powder materials: soil, ore, concentrate, dust, slag, cement, \nlimestone, dolomite, glass, quartz, clay, etc.\nHard materials prepared directly by traditional granule press or additive: \nferrosilicon, iron concentrate, etc.;Sample preparation method.\n - 项目业绩： \nPowder materials: soil, ore, concentrate, dust, slag, cement, limestone, \ndolomite, glass, quartz, clay, etc.\nHard materials prepared directly by traditional granule press or additive: \nferrosilicon, iron concentrate, etc.;Sample preparation method.\n",
